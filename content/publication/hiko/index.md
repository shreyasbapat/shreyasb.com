abstract: "The project is focused towards making the lives of people easy and comfortable. But doing this generally harms the environment , hence keeping this aspect in mind, this paper is based on the project of home automation system. The automation is done using recognising the speech taken by the user and the inputs taken by user on his mobile phone which in turn should be connected to internet. The environment is also protected because all the electric and electronic components in house can be accessed remotely. This reduces the human effort and saves a lot of energy. Because now, no mother has to call her son to tell him to switch off all the lights in the house before going out of the house, as she can just say “****room lights off” or tap on the button which says the same thing. This in turn also saves a lot of money."
