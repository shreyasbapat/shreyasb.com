  Python is a very handy tool when it comes to working with data, but at the same time it can be pretty slow to work with. With it's rise in the Scientific Computing World, and languages like Julia also coming in, it's important to understand how can one make Python Fast (Sometimes Even as fast as compiled languages like C). Learn more about Python Performance on this tech talk with Shreyas Bapat, B.Tech. IIT Mandi, who is spearheading efficiency initiatives at Semut.io
